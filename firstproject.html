<title>Zelon: The New Generation of Mathematics</title>
<body>
<h1 id="mainheader">Welcome to Zelon: The Future of Mathematical Representation</h1>

<section class="Section">
<h2>Our Motive</h2>
    <p>Zelon is the latest version of mathematical calculations. With the world growing at a very fast pace, mathematics continues to evolve. <br>
    Mathematics and Statistics is well represented in the world of Zelon.  Zelon offers ways to graph equations and solve equations as well. Recent new updates from the Zelon
Team continues to evolve the experience of Zelon.</p>

<h2>A Look At Our Programs</h2>
<p>Zelon uses multiple programs and lines of code to operate it's applications of graphing. By allowing the user to plug in many variables and euqations, Zelon is versatile
    in allowing the consumer to use Zelon to it's maximum capabilties.  Zelon and it's applications use the following coding systems to publoish it's work:
        <ul>
            <li>VisualStudio Code By Microsoft: IDE Workspace</li>
            <li>JavaScript Extension</li>
            <li>W3Schools Prorgamming</li>
            <li>GitHUb Open Source Code</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How Our Program Works</h2>
        <p>
            Our program begins with a lot of essential front-end xoding.  To our cient side, we try to make our website as user-friendly as possible.  We use JavSxript from 
            common sources to make our code open-source and best of all, <em>free!</em>
